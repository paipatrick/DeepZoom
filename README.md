# Web DeepZoom Toolkit (WDZT)

An extensible JavaScript framework for analysis of deep zoom images on the web.
See it in action on https://isg.nist.gov.

All the functionalities are described in the [https://isg.nist.gov/deepzoomweb/help](documentation).

## Development

### Building

We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for the building and testing scripts.
To get started you need to:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
1. Install Grunt via `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
1. Clone the WDZT repository.
1. Run `npm install` inside the cloned repository.
1. Install bower `npm install -g bower`.
1. Run `bower install`.

You are now ready to build via `grunt`.
If you want to build and execute the tests type `grunt all`.

### Folders contents

The repository is organized as follow:
* / contains the readme, license, build files as well as html files for testing.
* /closure-compiler contains the google closure compiler jar
* /css contains all the project's css files
* /data contains small test datasets
* /images contains the icons used by WDZT
* /libs contains the project dependencies
* /src contains the source code divided in the following sub-folders:
    * /src/ for the core components
    * /src/logic for logic code potentially reused by multiple modules
    * /src/modules for the modules
    * /stc/widgets for UI widgets potentially reused across multiple modules
* /test contains the qUnit tests with one test file for each src file

### Modules development

To implement a new module, create a new file your-module.js under src/modules
and extend the module class.
Add your module in the debug.html file for easy debugging.
You should also create the corresponding unit tests under 
test/modules/your-module.js. Your test file should be included in both test.html
and test-debug.html.
